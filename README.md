## Application Structure:
#### main.go: 
This is the entry point of the application. 
It sets up the Fiber web server, initializes the database, defines API routes, and listens for incoming requests.

#### lead/lead.go: 
This file contains the definition of the Lead struct, which represents the data structure for leads. 
It also includes functions to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for leads.

#### database/database.go: 
This file establishes the database connection using GORM (Object-Relational Mapping),
and defines a global database variable to be used throughout the application.

## Database Initialization:
When the application is started, the initDatabase function in main.go is called.
This function establishes a connection to an SQLite database named leads.db located in the project directory. 
It also performs an auto migration to ensure that the Lead model is properly mapped to the database.

## API Endpoints
#### The application provides the following API endpoints:
##### 1. Get All Leads
Endpoint: /api/v1/lead
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves a list of all leads from the database using the GetLeads function defined in lead/lead.go. 
The result is returned as a JSON response.

##### 2. Get Lead by ID
Endpoint: /api/v1/lead/:id
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves a lead by its unique ID from the database using the GetLead function defined in lead/lead.go. 
The result is returned as a JSON response.

##### 3. Create a New Lead
Endpoint: /api/v1/lead
Method: POST
Description: Creates a new lead by parsing the JSON request body and using the NewLead function defined in lead/lead.go. 
The newly created lead is returned as a JSON response.

##### 4. Delete Lead by ID
Endpoint: /api/v1/lead/:id
Method: DELETE
Description: Deletes a lead by its unique ID from the database using the DeleteLead function defined in lead/lead.go. 
A success message is sent as a response.

## TOOLS (And examples how to use in postman):
You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
Here some examples to Get All Leads:
localhost:7000/api/v1/lead,
For creating new lead (need to add in JSON):
'{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "company": "XYZ Corp",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
    "phone": 9876543210
}'
And then POST : localhost:7000/api/v1/lead
Also to change id : localhost:7000/api/v1/lead/2 <- adding after 'lead/' any number.

if you chose to use postman then you can test it: 

To interact with the CRM application using Postman:
Open Postman.

Import or manually create requests using the base URL http: //localhost:7000. Or any port you get.
Send requests to the various endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, DELETE) to interact with the CRM and observe the responses.

## Setup:
Make sure you have Go and Fiber installed on your system.
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

## Installation:
Clone this repository.
make sure you work in c enviroment.

## Initialize the database:
go run main.go
This will create an SQLite database named leads.db in your project directory.
Also Start the CRM application.
The application will start, and you can access it at http: //localhost:7000.
